# VR-Headset


## Getting Started

We created a VR Headset & Controller. The two devices are composed of many arduino components that captures the head orientation of the person wearing the headset and the movement using the controller within a game in unity. 

### Prerequisites

Install the Arduino IDE and Unity Game Engine

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Run the executible with the headset or Run it through Unity.

## Built With

* [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/) - Used for the microcontrollers 
* [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) - Used the two devices to interact with Unity's Game Engine
